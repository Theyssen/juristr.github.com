> *Disclaimer 1:* I actually work at Nrwl since January and was able to record this course as part of our 20% time, where we work on open source and other stuff. 

> *Disclaimer 2:* I've been an Nx user for much longer, even before joining Nrwl, simply because I'm convinced it helps developers in a variety of different ways be more productive and create higher quality outcomes.
