**Todos**

- how to use a field as a preview link

## Why?

- love Git => GitHub => static site variant
- Problem: git shell etc...locally on iPad doesn’t really work ...?
- hosting a server? for a blog? nahh
- best of both worlds: CMS => Git => static site (can still use the normal git push publishing flow if you want)

## Rolling your own solution

Use git bridge etc.. (see T-Mobile styleguide)

## Setup Netlify CMS

...
