  Why "from my iPad"? :sweat_smile: just a teaser, but actually all this started because I wanted to be able to write blog posts from my iPad. So here we go.

So I recently tweeted this:

And it's true. I've probably never blogged so few articles than in the last half year, which is sad for a couple of reasons: I love blogging & writing, I love content production, I love to engage with the community & ofc my page views dropped significantly :sad:

* how to use a field as a preview link

## Why?

* love Git => GitHub => static site variant
* Problem: git shell etc...locally on iPad doesn’t really work ...?
* hosting a server? for a blog? nahh

## Rolling your own solution

Use git bridge etc.. (see T-Mobile styleguide)

## Setup Netlify CMS
