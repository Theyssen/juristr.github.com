{{<intro>}}
  Why "from my iPad"? :sweat_smile: just a teaser, but actually all this started because I wanted to be able to write blog posts from my iPad. So here we go.

So I recently tweeted this:

{{<tweet 1275898074787909634 >}}

And it's true. I've probably never blogged so few articles than in the last half year, which is sad for a couple of reasons: I love blogging & writing, I love content production, I love to engage with the community & ofc my page views dropped significantly :disappointed:

So..kids change your life, for the better :heart: and don't get me wrong, I'd never change that. But obviously there's just so much time, so things need to be re-prioritized and most importantly your time needs another optimization boost :rocket:. A much bigger strike was Covid though. I've not been positive (yet), nor have family members (:pray:), but we had to re-arrange how we organize our house-hold and childcare time. While before we brought our little beloved one to his grandparents, during lock-down that was simply not possible. So me and my wife split our time which resulted in less free time + late hours working.

## My current blogging setup



## Adding Netlify CMS



**Todos**

* how to use a field as a preview link

## Why?

* love Git => GitHub => static site variant
* Problem: git shell etc...locally on iPad doesn’t really work ...?
* hosting a server? for a blog? nahh
* best of both worlds: CMS => Git => static site (can still use the normal git push publishing flow if you want)

## Rolling your own solution

Use git bridge etc.. (see T-Mobile styleguide)

## Setup Netlify CMS
