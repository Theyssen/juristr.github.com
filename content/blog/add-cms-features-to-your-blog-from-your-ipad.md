**Todos**

* how to use a field as a preview link

## Why?

* love Git => GitHub => static site variant
* Problem: git shell etc...locally on iPad doesn’t really work ...?
* hosting a server? for a blog? nahh
* best of both worlds: CMS => Git => static site (can still use the normal git push publishing flow if you want)

## Rolling your own solution

Use git bridge etc.. (see T-Mobile styleguide)

## Setup Netlify CMS

...
